The walk took us to following view.\\nWith a river and hills in the backdrop on one side, farming lands on the other. For many, it might be just a beautiful scenery or a great view. For me, it was nostalgic. Although I was born in a town, I grew up in a village where we didn't have a single shop.\\nTo buy anything I had to go to the neighbour village, crossing a lake and farming fields on sides of the road. The road that was elevated few times to prevent overflow of water from the lake when it rains heavily.
