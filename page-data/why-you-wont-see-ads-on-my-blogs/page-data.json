I just hate them. I hate them so much that i change my habits online or don't watch TV or rarely read newspapers (so full of ads - no news).\\nFor example take Instagram. After major update from Facebook to Instagram's algorithm, it always shows pictures of few people / accounts\\xA0based on previous activity. It has completely fucked up the feed. So I use Instagram rarely.\\nFacebook is obviously very high on this list. That is one reason I rarely login to facebook. In fact the only reason I have an account there is to share my views through my blog posts, to find long lost friends ( :P ) and to occasionally post few photos to show my friends i am still alive.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Many blogs run ads for revenue to support hosting fees. For me, its not much. So that is not an issue. If the website becomes more famous and traffic increases, they start to become greedy and run all kinds of ads.\\nAds intrude.

Its difficult to escape from google. I tried using DuckDuckGo search Engine. They shout out to say that they don't track you. But I was not satisfied with the quality of the returned results for any search. That's why I had to switch back to Google for search.\\nI use Google Maps, Photos, Gmail, YouTube (rarely now).

If you haven't watched TV lately, do for few hours / days. You will see same ads in many channels and those ads run for a long time.\\nThis is called planting into the viewers' minds.
