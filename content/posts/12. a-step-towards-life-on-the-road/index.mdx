On November 1st week of 2019, I decided to embark on a new journey, one aimed towards not escaping the hectic urban life but to jump out of my comfort zone discover new things to enjoy, meet new people, see new places and experience new moments to cherish. 







With that in mind, I vacated my room in Bengaluru where I used to stay with my friends, gave away most of my clothes except a few pairs, packed by bags, got my motorcycle serviced and ready for the start of something new.







Where was I going? Asansol. Near Kolkata, West Bengal, a place I've never been to. Why this place you ask? Well, one of my friend was getting married there and I had promised him I would attend his wedding and I would reach there on my bike.







Thats how this journey started. And was it any good? Was it exciting, adventurous? Did I face any problems? Where did I head next? Did i meet any crazy heads / travelers during my journey?







Its a long story and I intend to put into words now that all of us are trapped inside our homes because of Covid-19. Little did we know that it was going to bring whole world to a stop. I had to cut short my journey and head back home, with all my luggage, my motorcycle left somewhere near Guwahati, Assam.







To give me company, one of my friend had joined me in February of 2020. We both have taken a break to handle Covid threat. We intend to resume our journey when all this is over.







Continue to follow for more updates on my journey.
