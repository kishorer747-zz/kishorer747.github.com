I am going to keep this post short & crisp, unlike other ones :)

One thing good about Bengaluru is there are lot of places you can visit around this city and are really beautiful. In all 4 states - Karnataka, Andhra, Kerala and TamilNadu.
One such place is Ramnagara, some 50KM from center of Bengaluru. Its a quiet place beautiful completely rock hills and a lake. Where you can go for boating and kayaking - its not challenging but you get the idea of how fun it can be.
We all reached there in the morning by buses arranged by our beloved HR. 

There was a walk for 1KM or so, to get to the resort where few activities were planned. The walk took us to following view.
With a river and hills in the backdrop on one side, farming lands on the other. For many, it might be just a beautiful scenery or a great view. For me, it was nostalgic. Although I was born in a town, I grew up in a village where we didn't have a single shop.
To buy anything I had to go to the neighbour village, crossing a lake and farming fields on sides of the road. The road that was elevated few times to prevent overflow of water from the lake when it rains heavily. I used to enjoy the walk every single time.
As soon as we reached the resort all of us felt the hunger in us when we saw the breakfast ready to be served. It was not that great.

Now it was time to get people warmed up for activities like Zip lining, Kayaking, a small trek and rappelling. The guide / host there started to group people and made them dance and do these crazy steps which lead to everyone bursting into laughter.
We were advised to split into groups to attend different activities in parallel to avoid rush. I wanted to go for kayaking first. It looked calm and it was a wish since forever. And it was memorable. The water in the lake was calm but it was good. The weather supported us too, it was not too sunny, not too cloudy, just perfect.

Never had i thought an office team outing would be so fun. Kayaking was followed by Zip Lining - probably 30 meters or so. It was a short distance but ok-ish. I had been to Rishikesh and did Flying Fox where i was accelerated to speeds of 150+ kmph and it was nearly 1 KM!
Few of us wanted to go for rapelling and we started to move towards a small rocky hill. We were just searching for a way to reach the rapelling spot and we climbed this small rocky hill - the view from atop was so cool. You could see everything from above and to make it more interesting, it started to drizzle.

I enjoy rain. Although many feel like rain is an interruption, for me its not. Those rain drops falling on your face, especially when you are riding on a bike. Its like small insects biting playfully on your face. I would never get bored of this feeling hopefully!

Here are few select images from my camera. There are tons of cool pics but all are office-only restricted.
