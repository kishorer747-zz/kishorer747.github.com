Here a short summary of some of the places I've been to:

**Bhopal: City of Lakes** <br/> - visited during March, started raining a bit. Overall weather was decent, a bit sunny. Must visit New Market - wide array of shopping stalls, amazing varieties of food to eat, all in one place. Night ride/walk on VIP road by the lake, to enjoy peaceful evening.
